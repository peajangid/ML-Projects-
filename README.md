# ML-Projects-
This Repository contains the projects which are made using ML algorithms such as  Logistic regression, Linear Regression, Neural Network, etc
# 1. Ad Click Prediction Using Logistic Regression
This project aims to build a predictive model using Logistic Regression to determine whether a user will click on an advertisement based on their features. The dataset used in this project is a simulated dataset representing users' behaviors on a company's website.
## Conclusion: 
The Logistic Regression model developed for predicting user ad clicks performed exceptionally well on the test data. The model achieved an accuracy of 96.67%, indicating that it correctly classified the majority of instances. The precision of 96.05% shows that the model is highly reliable in predicting actual clicks among those it flagged as likely to click. With a recall of 97.33%, the model successfully identified most of the true positives. The high AUC score of 0.9912 further confirms the model's robustness in distinguishing between users who are likely to click on an ad and those who are not. Overall, the model provides a reliable tool for predicting user engagement with advertisements based on their online behavior and demographic features.

# 2. Movie Recommender System
In this project i created a recomder system for the movies data set that contains information about the movies rating, date,reviews, starred actors directors, ect.
## Conclusion
  In this project I developed a recommendation system using cosine similarity to provide personalized suggestions based on item features. Also attempted to process and analyz data to compute similarity scores between items for accurate content recommendations. Implemented the system using Python and libraries like Pandas and NumPy, enhancing user experience through tailored recommendations.Also used pycharm for creating an application using streamlit to run the model on browser.

# 3. SMS spam/ham classifier
In this project i used NLP to process the data and then used ML to model the data for the classification process.
## Conclusion
I used NLP to preprocess the data to use the data for the classifiaction using the nNaive bayes. The Binomial Naive bayes gives the best accuracy and precision. I also used different model using different algorithms to analyse and compare the performance matrices with the different model out of which Deep Tress gave better accuracy and precision similar to Naive Bayes. Then Procedded to create an application to classify the message into spam or ham using pycharm and streamlit.
